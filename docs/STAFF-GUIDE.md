# Staff picture guide

How the bird looks after install, and what to do in Settings.

---

## Main popup

Click the bird icon (pin it so the badge stays visible).

![Main popup — Bird Alert, On Duty, Orders in Queue](guide-popup.png)

| Piece | What it means |
|--------|----------------|
| **BIRD ALERT** | Tap to cycle HIGH / MED / LOW / 1 ORDER / OFF |
| **⚙** | Opens Settings |
| Clock | Your local time |
| **ON DUTY** | Who’s on Nookmart from the schedule (needs schedule unlocked once) |
| **ORDERS IN QUEUE** | Unfilled / waiting count — same number as the badge on the icon |

## Settings — API key & queue watch

Gear → Settings. Paste **your own** Hub key (don’t share it).

![Settings — Strobe Hub API key and queue check speed](guide-settings-api.png)

1. Get a key at [strobe.gg/core/settings](https://strobe.gg/core/settings)
2. Paste → **Save**
3. You should see **Polling every … · last … ago**
4. Optional: **Poll now**, **Queue check speed**, **Check for update**
5. **Pause monitoring** stops queue alerts only — lookup still works

---

## Settings — schedule (who’s on duty)

Scroll down in Settings for the schedule block.

![Settings — schedule loaded and refresh](guide-settings-schedule.png)

1. Open [strobe.twizt.shop](https://strobe.twizt.shop/) once in the **same** Brave/Chrome profile as the bird (sign in / Access code if asked)
2. Status should turn green: **Schedule loaded (… ago) · auto-refresh ~every 4h**
3. Or paste CSV and hit **Save**
4. Use **Refresh schedule now** anytime

If Access needs a new code, the bird warns you: **Bird can't fly without the schedule code** — open the schedule site and sign in again.
